PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

The RAMB18E1 cantavi_streamer_project_i/AudioProcessingChannel/eth_to_audio_plc_com_0/U0/FIFO_LEFT_EVEN_OutDAC/Mem_reg has an input control pin cantavi_streamer_project_i/AudioProcessingChannel/eth_to_audio_plc_com_0/U0/FIFO_LEFT_EVEN_OutDAC/Mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[10] (net: cantavi_streamer_project_i/AudioProcessingChannel/eth_to_audio_plc_com_0/U0/FIFO_LEFT_EVEN_OutDAC/pNextWordToWrite[5]) which is driven by a register (cantavi_streamer_project_i/AudioProcessingChannel/eth_to_audio_plc_com_0/U0/FIFO_LEFT_EVEN_OutDAC/GrayCounter_pWr/q_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (cantavi_streamer_project_i/org_audio2eth_interl_0/U0/FIFO_EVEN_InADC/Mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
