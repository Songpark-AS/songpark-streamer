This folder contains 2 folders: sd1 and sd2, these two folders contain the files to be added to the SDCards

The difference between the two folders is in the mac adresses contained in devicetree.dtb files (device trees)

We no longer have to configure the MAC on the command line this is now set in the dtb files.

sd1 should be placed in one sdcard and sd2 in the other sdcard

To setup just replace the corresponding files on the SD cards with these files

It is just like last time:


uImage, devicetree.dtb and BOOT.bin go to the first partition (boot partition)

connect is the application, it goes to the /usr/bin/ folder
